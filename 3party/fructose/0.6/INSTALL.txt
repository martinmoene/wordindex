FRUCTOSE is designed to work just using the header files,
so there is no build and install as such. Simply make the
headers available in whatever part of your compilation
environment you find convenient. Note that they must reside
in a directory called fructose.

The examples come with Makefiles. The Makefiles have been
produced using the build system MakeProjectCreator (MPC).
The MPC input files are supplied along with the Makefiles
they produced. The Makefiles are suitable for use with
most Unix systems. The MPC files can be used to produce
project files that will work with various versions of
Microsoft Visual Studio (6,7,8).

There is a component called generator, which is built using
the mpc file or Makefile in the top level directory.
This is an optional code generator. Its use is shown in ex6
in the examples directory.
