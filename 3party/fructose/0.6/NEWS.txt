This is version 0.6.0 which has a bug fix for the loop asserts so that
they now work when the reverse flag is used on the command line.
I have also provided uppercase versions of the fructose macros.
Some people felt strongly that all macros should be in uppercase,
so now everyone has the choice.

I have received several emails with feedback, fixes and enhancements,
so this version is being prompted in status on SourceForge from
Alpha to Beta. Note that there is still some documentation to do
and some functionality to add, hence it is not 1.0.0 yet.
 
Version 0.5.0 had a code generator which was contributed by Chris Main.

Version 0.4.0 had some interface and documentation improvements.

The first official release of FRUCTOSE was 0.2.0.
Version 0.1.0 was a version I sent to Peter Sommerlad, when I hoped
we would be able to combine the best elements of FRUCTOSE with CUTE.
However, sadly, Peter was too busy so after a few refinements
I released the next version on my own.
