Automatic test harness generation by Chris Main.

This package evolved after many discussions and approaches to unit testing.
CppUnit remains the grand unit test framework, this is a very much cutdown
and simplified one. It has been inspired by CppUnit. Several of the ideas
connected with combining test harness development with command line
handling were as a result of joint work between myself and Andreas Stirneman.
FRUCTOSE has also taken some inspiration from CUTE by Peter Sommerlad. 
The ideas about one class/one test harness and about loop
asserts are thanks to some discussions about testing I had with John Lakos.
I also owe thanks to Salvatore Lovene, who made me aware of the TCLAP library
for command line argument handling.
