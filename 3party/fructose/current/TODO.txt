I really need to include more examples. Ahem.

I am considering moving the license to GPLv3.
Stay tuned.

I have decided not to support ancient compilers such
as the Sparcworks 4.2 Sun compiler, which
does not have the STL and does not support namespaces.
This pathetic excuse of a compiler is still in use
in a number of commercial organisations.
Tough luck.
